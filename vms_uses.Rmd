## Applications of VMS data

- Beyond its immediate use (monitoring), VMS data is a valuable source of information

VMS data can be used to
- Describe the spatial distribution of fishing effort and of catch
- Evaluate changes in the distribution of effort through time
- Examine the behaviour of fishing vessels
- Evaluate the level of compliance with spatial closures
- Study the impact of fishing gear on sea bottom habitats

## Examples of uses of VMS data in Iceland and how this can be adapted for local use
   - Mapping effort of different fishing fleets/gears
   - Overlap with cold-water corals (protected features)
   - Identify Nephrops fishing areas and monitor the movement of the fleet

## Evaluating the impact of fishing on cold-water corals
- In the North Atlantic /Lophelia pertusa/ is the main reef-forming coral

- /Lophelia/ reefs are fragile and can be damaged by bottom trawlers.

- We used VMS+ELB data to
  - Evaluate the distribution of fishing effort near coral areas
  - Design spatial closures to protect coral habitats
  - Minimise conflicts with the fishery
